Provider Information Return 
(PIR) - Hospices

Purpose: 


We are changing the way we are regulating and inspecting adult social care. To understand more 
about why, how and when we are changing; and our priorities and principles please look at our 
consultation on how we propose to regulate, inspect and rate services 

link. 


This PIR is an important element of our new inspection process. We are asking for this information 
under Regulation 10(3) of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 
2010. Please provide the information we require using this form. It will help us plan our inspections 
by asking you to provide us with data, and some written information under the questions: 


• Is the service safe? 
• Is it effective? 
• Is it caring? 
• Is it responsive? 
• Is it well-led? 


This return is being used as a pre-inspection questionnaire and we would like you to fill it in and 
return it to us by the 11th July 2014. We won't tell you in advance when your inspection will be, 
and the date you receive or return the form will not decide the date we visit your service. The 
information you include in your return will help inspectors decide on the areas they need to look at 
during their visit. Some of the content may also be used to inform national reporting. When we use 
information in this way, it won't be attributed to any provider. You might find it helpful to use the 
return as part of your quality assurance process and as a way of understanding and reviewing how 
well you are meeting the five ‘key questions’.

• This should be recorded as the number of visits to specifically assess the quality of your service which have taken place.
• Only include visits by senior managers who:
• Talked to people using services.
• Visited the offices.
• Undertook a professional, formal assessment of the quality of the service.
• Ad-hoc visits that were brief, office-based and did not provide any assessment of quality should not be included. 
• Details of these visits should be included in section 5a to increase the evidence that your service is well-led.)
